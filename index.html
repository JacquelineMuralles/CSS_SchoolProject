					Hello, my name is Jacqueline Muralles, Jackie for short, and this is my portfolio webpage! I am a United States Air Force Veteran and currently attending Texas State University. I will be graduating Fall 2021 with a major in Digital Media Innovation and a minor in Latina/o Studies. I created this website to show off the different skills I have acquired within the last few years since leaving the military. I have a lot to offer potential employers and range of interests which means not only will I enjoy what I do, but I will always look for ways to improve. 
				</p>
				<h2>About Me!</h2>
				<p>
					I grew up in, was raised in, and I currently live in San Antoio, TX. I live in a home in Southtown with my husband of almost three years and our fur baby, Jameson (yes, after the whiskey). My husband works with a local startup as a software developer and, other than school, I manage branding and social media for my podcast, Amigas Crossing, and for Avilia Advisory. One thing the military got me adicted to is traveling! I have visited seven countries and my husband and I went on a 5 day road trip from Boston, MA (his hometown) to San Antonio, TX. I used to skateboard as a angsty teenager but now I stick to more subtle hobbies like photography, coding, reading, dancing, cooking, and long boarding. My life has been such an amazing adventure and I look forward to everything it still has in store for me!
				</p>
				<h2>Education</h2>
				<p>
					On top of my military education I also have an associates of arts from San Antonio College where I studied photography and journalism. I then transferred to Texas State University to pursue my bachelors. In the middle of my time at Texas State I took a semester off to attend a five month software development course. I graduated the course alongside my husband in June 2020. By the time I graduate I will have had experience in the following:

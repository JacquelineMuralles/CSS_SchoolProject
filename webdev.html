	<h1>Web Development Projects</h1>
	<p>
		In Fall of 2019 I enrolled into Fundementals of Digital and Online Meda at Texas State University. This was the first time I ever started coding. I learned how to use HTML, CSS and a little bit of WordPress. By the end of the course I had made a small blog and had designed a small HTML page. I used this blog, <a href="https://jackiemuralles.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Hilos</a>, to interview local heroes, icons, and innovators in San Antonio, TX. I mostly used free WordPress layouts and themes. But, this class launched my love for coding and tech. 
	</p>
	<p>
		With my new skills and my newfound love for tech and coding I decided to do something big. Instead of attending Texas State University in the Spring of 2020, I decided I would take the semester off. Instead, I would enroll into San Antonio coding bootcamp, Codeup! I wanted to learn more languages and get a full-stack web development certification. My husband liked the idea so much, he enrolled as well. We spend the next five months completing projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, MySQL, SpringBoot, and Java. You can see most of my projects by visiting my <a href="https://github.com/JacquelineMuralles" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account. They even helped us look for, apply for, and obtain jobs as software developers. They even took professional photographs of us!

		This course was tough! It challanged my ability to learn things quickly, my organizational skills, my time management skills, and once COVID-19 hit it challenged my ability to adapt quickly. One of my best projects was actually completed with a team of me and three other class-mates. We created an application using Java, SpringBoot and two API's that allows users to plan out virtual gardens. This application, GardenSeedr, gives user's information on the crops they want to grow and allows them to annotate any changes they make to their gardens. You can watch our video below.
